## NestJS Sample application

### About

This is a fictional auto dealership website illustrating how to use feature flags in NestJS. Since Nest is considered a server-side framework, the frontend components were developed using Vue.js. The complete frontend can be found in the **client** folder.

Here's a short breakdown of the app:

On the home page of the website, just under the banner. I've added:

- **A newsletter subscription form** - Let's consider this to be a pre-existing component of the site.
- **A fuel mileage calculator** - The new feature to be rolled out.

### Prerequisites for running the app

1. Open a terminal in the root of this repo and run the following command to install the **npm packages**.
